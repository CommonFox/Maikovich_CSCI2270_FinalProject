Twitter Story of the Day

Project Summary
The overall idea of the project is to create a user created story through Twitter, using the Twitter API. An introduction to the story will either be given or user controlled, then users will continually add and contribute to the story. Responses will be chosen and then posted so that other users will know where to pick up and submit their new additions. At the end of the set period the finished story will be posted in its entirety.
